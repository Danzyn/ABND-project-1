# ABND-project-1
First project for Android Basics Nano Degree, on Udacity.

This is a basic business card type app, that serves solely for education purposes.
It is intended for the reviewer team of udacity.com (hi guys/gals).

About the project
-
This is a simple „hello udacity” project, I guess. The „business” I chose is a pet project of mine that will see the light of the internet this year (hopefully): a platform for science&technology enthusiasts.

What I did besides the minimum requirements
-
Added portrait/landscape functionality. Doing that, I created an extra xml file that holds identical code for the portrait and landscape orientations (the description, www and the address views). I did this to easily change the content, in a single place.

How it was tested
-
The app was tested with 2 virtual devices (Nexus 5X api 24 and Pixel XL api 22) and one physical device (Samsung Galaxy 7 edge, running android 7).
